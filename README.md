### Create Conda Environment
* Create Conda Virtual Environment for better experience
  ```sh
  conda create --name tf
  ```
  Then
  ```sh
  conda activate tf
  ```
### Now Installation
* Pytorch   (Download as your PC requirement)
  ```sh
  conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio cudatoolkit=11.3 -c pytorch
  ```
* Numpy
  ```sh
  pip install numpy
  ```




## Clone the Repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/roshan1208/Text-Generation-using-LSTM-and-pytorch.git
   ```

## Application: Detect Mask on Live Video feed-----(Laptop Camera)
1. If you want to generate new text of corpus dataset 'alice.txt', then 
2. Clone the repo
3. Run `main.py`  

  
## Understand the Code
### 1. Train on simple LSTM Network
 
 Open `Text Generation through LSTM.ipynb` and Follow along as discuss in that file
